James Munnis
Milestone 1 <27/09/24>
--------------------------------

New Functionality
-----------------

-Playing Animations
-Loading, unloading and displaying textures
-Performance tracking, fps and fps graph

Code Additions
--------------

-Animation (Handles playing animation on a target sprite)
-Texture Utils (Handles all texture utility, loading, unloading and managing textures)
-Performance Metrics (Handles calculating a smoothed fps and collecting samples for the fps graph)


Tests
-----

-Can enter wrong file paths for the texture utils and it will handle them, by either displaying a error texture and displaying an error message box or if it cant
grab error texture generate one from code. If all fails inform user to reinstall game.
-Runs in both debug and release



James Munnis
Milestone 2+3 <18/11/2024>
--------------------------------

New Functionality
-----------------

-Custom Maths Library
-Components and game objects
-Collision Debug tools
-Better sprite handling and animation
-Scene system and loading
-Better game framework via game class
-Optional Collision events and listener 
-Optional Collision layers
-Other tweaks


--Custom Physics Engine--
Supports:
-Particle Simulation
-Force generators
-Simple rigid body physics
-AABB collision and resolution

Code Additions
--------------

-GameObject(Holds all components associated with it and other func)
-Component(Base class for all components to inherit from, contains Start,Update,Render)
-TransformComp(Holds X,Y)
-SpriteRenderComp(Renderers sprites and animas)
-PhysicsBodyComp(Used as interface between the gameobject and physics engine)
-Character Controller (Used to control a gameobject)
-Vector(Has all functionality such as cross product, proper operator overloaded for multiple cases such as * being used for both scalar and dot product, etc)
-EditorGui(Can show bounding boxes, list of gameobjects and edit their 
-More smaller additions

Tests
-----

-Cant add multiple of the same components to one gameobject
-Physics engine handles multiple bodies colliding together and push against eachother
-All works in both debug and release
